With cluster-api as a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.

Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
